<h3>Funny Face (1957)</h3>

<p>As far as fashion films go, they don’t get much more joyous than Funny Face. Audrey Hepburn stars as Jo Stockton, 
 a shy New York City bookshop assistant who dreams of studying philosophy in Paris. Her aspirations are realized through the 
 unlikeliest of means after she becomes a muse to the celebrated fashion photographer Dick Avery, played by Fred Astaire. Packed
 with gorgeous Parisian set pieces, delightful tunes by George and Ira Gershwin, and exquisite dresses crafted both by legendary
 costumier Edith Head and regular Hepburn collaborator Hubert de Givenchy, it’s a perfect ode to the joys of haute couture.

<h3>Blow-Up (1966) </h3>

<p>One of the more sinister entries on the list, this darkly glamorous thriller directed by Italian auteur Michelangelo Antonioni 
    is set within the heady heights of Swinging Sixties London. It weaves an unlikely tale of intrigue centered around David Hemmings’s
     lusty fashion photographer Thomas, who believes he has accidentally photographed a murder taking place. With hindsight, the
      complicated protagonist’s attitude to his female subjects is very much a product of its time—but the film’s menacing thrills 
      are leavened by a number of fabulous cameos, from Veruschka to Jane Birkin. Blow-Up today serves as a fascinating document of 
      a pivotal moment in fashion history.</p>

<h3>Who Are You, Polly Maggoo? (1966)</h3>

<p>Who Are You, Polly Maggoo? may have been released in the same year as Blow-Up, but its vision of the Swinging Sixties is altogether
     more surrealist and willfully satirical. Directed by the American photographer and filmmaker William Klein, the film pokes fun at
      the excesses and frivolities of the fashion industry in a way that manages to be both glamorous and grotesque. Come for the 
      costumes—which offer a brilliantly realized time capsule of 1960s style and have since inspired Jean-Paul Gaultier and Marc 
      Jacobs—and stay for the brilliant performance by Grayson Hall as Miss Maxwell, an imperious, Diana Vreeland-esque fashion editor 
      whose pithy remarks can make or break a career.</p>
